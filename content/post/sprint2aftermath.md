Sprint 2 wasn't really going well in terms of team morale and management. We could have done a lot better in this sprint with a little bit more self management and overall team cooperation. Which is why in this post I would like to talk about the difficulties that we face in this sprint and how we would try to fix it

## Past Week's Work
Leading up to the sprint review, I was in charge of creating the stepper for the onboarding. We initially wanted to use a ViewPager, but due to the library used by Fersandi for the bubbles it was scrapped because the ViewPager slider conflicts with the bubble slide function. Therefore we decided to have an activity for every step of the onboarding process. This was not pretty, obviously. But, there was no time to think of alternatives. Other that onboarding, I also cleaned up several bugs in the layout.

## Pre Sprint Problems
During the early weeks of the sprint. We don't really have any problems as everyone was moving at their own pace. But, everything chages near the sprint review. Most of the team was sick because of a lack of sleep and insomnia, especially Fersandi and Felicia who haven't slept for several days. Felicia also had problems with her laptop as it was serviced poorly prior to the pre-review hackathon. Which is why I borrowed my laptop to her and proceed to do pair programming with Fersandi. On the backend side, thighs are going pretty good except for the data seeding which is supposed to be done by Vincent who was down sick due to some sort of neck pain and shivering. This leaves Wibi and Stef to program the rest of the backend. Though it was completed in the end, there was not enough time to integrate it.
