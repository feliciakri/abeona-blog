Agile development has been the staple for Software Development for quite a long time. It's where you turn when you want to develop a Software while also wanting to accommodate changes mid development in order to better suit the market needs. So what exactly is Agile Development? And how do you implement it in your next project?

## Agile Manifesto & Principles
Agile is a software development method that is based on the agile manifesto and its 12 principles. Agile development closely follows its four points of its manifesto which are:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

Therefore from those 4 main points, agile had developed its own 12 principles which are:
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Scrum Introduction

“Agile Development” is an umbrella term for several iterative and incremental software development methodologies. The most popular agile methodologies include Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, Crystal, Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), Lean Development, and Feature-Driven Development (FDD). While they all differ in methodologies, they all follow the same core values (Agile Manifesto). In our case, we've used the Scrum methodology for our software development.

Scrum is a subset of Agile. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one. Scrum processes enable organizations to adjust smoothly to rapidly-changing requirements, and produce a product that meets evolving business goals using iterative and incremental practices. An agile Scrum process benefits the organization by helping it to
- Increase the quality of the deliverables
- Cope better with change (and expect the changes)
- Provide better estimates while spending less time creating them
- Be more in control of the project schedule and state

## How to Scrum

So how do you do scrum? Here's a simple infographic:
![Scrum Development Guideline](/img/Scrum.jpg)
A team in a Scrum Development consists of the developer, the product owner, and the scrum master. At the beginning of development, the team first creates a product backlog. The product backlog is a list of main features that will be implemented by the developers. The product backlog must be able to be understood by the developers and the businesspersons. The product backlog can be built by receiving inputs from customers, the team, managers, executives, etc. Each backlog item is also assigned with a number proportional to its difficulty.

Afterwards its time for the spring planning. The team selects the backlog items they want to work on this sprint. The team then defines the tasks that are needed in order the implement the backlog item. This list of tasks are called the sprint backlog. This tasks can be either added, removed, or assigned every sprint meeting. Afterwards, the team picks the task that they want to do and proceed to implement it. In our case, we are limited to one task per sprint meeting.

Every day, the developers and the scrum master meet up for the daily sprint meeting. In the daily sprint meeting, every member on the dev team talks about what they've done yesterday, what they're planning to do today, and problems that they've encountered. It is also in this sprint meeting that tasks move around the scrum board. Completed tasks go into the done section while new tasks may be added where needed, or removed when deemed not necessary. Since we are working while attending class normally, our sprint meetings are done not daily, but twice a week.

A sprint in scrum lasts about 1-4 weeks. In a sprint, it is necessary to produce an MVP in every sprint. MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product, the barest state of the software that is still marketable and usable by its user. This MVP is presented at the sprint review at the end of a sprint. During the sprint review, the team gathers to review the MVP made during that sprint. The sprint masters guides throughout the whole process, while the product owner has a say in the resulting MVP. The product owner can either approve or reject the MVP, either wholly or part of it. The rejected part of the software then carries on the next sprint to be fixed. Afterwards it is time for sprint retrospective. In sprint retrospective, the dev teams evaluate themselves over the entire sprint. The team shall review every individual on their performance during the sprint, and what could be done better. Afterwards, its back to sprint planning, and everything starts all over again.

The cycle repeats until enough items in the product backlog have been completed, the budget is depleted, or a deadline arrives. Which of these milestones marks the end of the work is entirely specific to the project. No matter which impetus stops work, Scrum ensures that the most valuable work has been completed when the project ends.
