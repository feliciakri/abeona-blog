As one of two hipsters in the team, I took over the second part of the mockup creation, the high fidelity one based on low fidelity mockup provided by other hipster, Tjokorde.

# Design Decisions
## NLP vs CI
At the beginning of idea exploration, our team was quite decided about NLP, and our product owner was pretty lenient about the technology we would use. Some of the NLP engines we considered was Kata.ai and Firebase's Api.ai.
But I decided to use Conversational Interface for several reasons

1. **User have unnatural expectations for today's AI**. This probably caused by numbers of Sci-Fi movies out there. The average precision rate for NLP technologies nowadays is around 60%, this is even lower for NLP in Bahasa. Users have significantly low tolerance about the error rate a chatbot has, and very high expectations.

2. **Cost effectiveness**. NLP APIs are expensive, we simply couldn't afford the rate just to create an app for this subject. Moreover, the training data needed to create a negligible chatbot is simply not practical.

3. **Simplification over complexity**. With CI, we aim to hold user's attention rather than giving subhuman responses and service. User don't have to figure out what command to do something, just pick from available buttons.

## Style
### Font
The font we used for the app is *Noto sans* and *Noto serif* both available on Google Fonts.

### Color
Main colors of Abeona is green and blue.
Blue because it is associated with tech and innovation. It also gives sense of security and safety.
Green because it gives calming effect and it represents growth.

### Inspiration
I got alot of inspiration from Ada, a CI based health companion app. Others include Zomato, Go-Food and Flip

## Closing
From usability testing done just yesterday, it seems that the green color perceived weird. It seems that the shade should be more pastel-y. Furthermore, the order page is incomplete since we are stll undecided about the kinds of data that would be saved in the database. This will be concluded in a few days.
