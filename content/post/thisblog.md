As per the requirement of this course, this blog is made to document the journey of Aboena. Plenty of blogging platform out there, all are so mainstream. We like complicated, cutting edge and hipster technology so we refused to use them all. Actually, Fersandi did insists to use medium blog in order to reduce headache. But what kind of life is that XD.

So here we are, a non mainstream blog based on Hugo, a golang static website generator deployed through Codeship CD for every push to this blog's git master branch on surge.sh. Which, by the way is quite a big feat of creating this. Since I'm the only one insisting on using edgy technology, the setup of this blog is mainly done by me.

## Behind the hood
Basically all you need is [github](github.com), [hugo](gohugo.io), [codeship](codeship.com), and [surge](surge.sh)
