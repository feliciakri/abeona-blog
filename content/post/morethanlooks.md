In order to create cohesive, human-friendly conversational interface that can *converse* with human is not an easy task. Plenty of preparation, design and considerations must be made. This blog entry covers my effort to study good conversational UI/UX, Content Modelling, bot flow, and information architecture.

*We try our best to make every design decisions meaningful*

## Botman Begins

The creation of Abeona's flow is heavily researched and structured upon articles credited on the end of this article.

The first thing to do is creating the **First Model**. This is basic modelling of what our main data is, how one entity relates to others, and their main characteristics. The model also serves as rough ERD.

With first model, we can determine the bot's main goal and ideas. Concept Map is our method of choice to compile our ideas and their relation. Our concept map is a simple 5W+1H covering basic goal and relations.

Finally, information architecture can be made. This serves as the guideline for information placement in our app. Kind of sitemap, but not quite.
