The 8 golden rules of interface design is a set of rules devised by Ben Shneiderman to guide aspiring interaction designers to ensure a great, productive, and frustration-free user interfaces. The characteristics of each rules can be found in every interface design guidelines produced by every major corporations in the world. Which is why in this post, I would like to talk about these 8 rules and also its application in our mobile app.

Our mockup can be accessed at [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/XSCF4u9ou9hVbYf4FJLhqwAQ/Abeona)

# Strive for Consistency
Humans strive for consistency in their actions. By using the same font, icons, font hierarchy, call-to actions, and user flow. A standard look and actions ensures that user can use the app comfortably without the need to learn new representations for the same actions. This ensures that the users can reach their goal of using the product more easily.
In Abeona, we strive for this by creating a design guideline that the designers adhere to.

We've also applied guidelines for our layout and call-to actions.

The menu bar is always at the bottom which serves to ease user navigation between the app that is present in most pages. The header with its back button and hamburger menu that is consistent in every page. And the overall layout of the app from the chat screen to the location listing that stayed consistent. Those are but some examples on how to achieve consistency in your design.

# Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
With increased use, users will demand faster way for them to complete tasks. Therefore with more experience the user has, the faster they can navigate and operate the user interface. These shortcuts can include hotkeys, macros, and hidden commands. For example, in our app there is a "I already have somewhere in mind" button that can be used for frequent users to quickly create a plan for their travels. There is also the navbar on the bottom that enables swift navigation throughout the app.

# Offer informative feedback
The user should know where they are and what they are doing at any time. This can be achieved by using unique visual cues and human-readable feedback every time the user attempts to do an action. Here's an example
![Informative Feedback Example](/img/feedback.png)
In the image above, the user knows that they are planning a trip based
on the "Trip Planning" text on the toolbar above. They also know that they are now required to fill in a date for their trip. This is because of the chat message sent by the bot and also because of the big "Pick a Date" button present on the bottom of the screen.

# Design dialogue to yield closure
Don't keep your users guessing. Every action that they complete should lead to a conclusion. This closure could be something as simple as a "Thank You!" message after the user has completed a task.

# Offer simple error handling
Users will make mistakes, therefore it's important to tell them what they did wrong. Ensure that users are provided with simple and intuitive steps to solve their problems as swiftly and as painlessly as possible. A good example of this is flagging the text fields where the user forgot to provide input on a form.

# Permit easy reversal of actions
Shneiderman stated in his book that easy reversal of actions is important, as quoted from his book: "This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone; it thus encourages exploration of unfamiliar options.". Therefore as a designer, it's important to offer users an easy way to reverse their actions.

In the example above, we've provided a "I Changed my mind" button for users who clicked the wrong destination while planning their trip.

# Support internal locus of control
Allow your users to be the initiators of actions. Give users the sense that they are in full control of events occurring in the digital space. This way, the users earn your trust by believing that the system behaves exactly as they expected. A simple way to achieve this within our app is by providing our users with a profile page that is full of options for them to explore and interact more with our system. The navbar and toolbar also help in achieving a sense of control for the user

# Reduce short-term memory load
human attention is limited and we are only capable of maintaining around five items in our short-term memory at one time. Therefore, interfaces should focus on user recognition over recollection. Recognizing is always easier than recollecting because recognition uses less short-term memory than recollecting. As humans are limited to around five items at a time, we present large images in a card view instead of a list view so that users can easily recognize the services that we provide on screen. As such, we've also made sure that no more than 6 items are present at one time on the screen in our browse page

When you follow these 8 rules, you will always end up with a user interface that is great, productive, and frustration-free interfaces just like the world's most popular apps. As long as your technology requires a human and computer interaction, these 8 rules are paramount for your design.

While you're at it check out our design for our application [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/XSCF4u9ou9hVbYf4FJLhqwAQ/Abeona), you might see more on it than written above!
